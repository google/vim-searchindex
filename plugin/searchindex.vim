""" IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

""" SEARCH TRIGGER
" It's tricky to detect when search is done precisely. We achieve this with
" two-level mappings:
" * conditional mapping of <CR> in cmdline / cmdwin. It checks command type to
"   only add <Plug>SearchIndex after search, not ex command or anything else.
" * mode-specific remappings of said <Plug> command that only display search
"   index in normal mode
" This way, if user performs search in non-normal mode, we don't clobber it
" (we could consider showing index in visual when noshowmode is set).
"
""" STAR COMMANDS OVERRIDE
" One Vim's quirk is that '*' and '#' commands silently ignore smartcase
" option. This is not detectable, which makes it impossible to count number of
" matches after 'star' commands correctly.
" Instead of hacking around this problem, we provide our own implementations
" of star commands. Additional advantage is that their case-sensitiveness can
" be controlled with a new option.
"
""" CACHING
" To improve efficiency, we cache results of last counting. This makes 'n'
" super fast. We only cache linewise counts, and in-line part is always
" recalculated. This prevents counting error from building up after multiple
" searches if in-line count was imprecise (which happens with regex searches).
