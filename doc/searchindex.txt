*searchindex.txt*  Display current & total number of search matches

INTRODUCTION                                    *searchindex*

This plugin helps you figure out how many times does a search pattern occur
in the current buffer. After each search, it will display total number of
matches, as well as the index of a current match, in a command line.

Consider the following example ("|" indicates cursor position): >
  99 bottles of beer on the wall, | 99 bottles of beer.
  Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
<
After searching for "beer", the command line will display: >
  [2/3]  /beer
<
SearchIndex works out of the box with all the usual search commands:
   |/|   |?|   |q/|   |q?|   |n|   |N|   |star|   |#|   |gstar|   |g#|

It caches the results, so stepping with |n| / |N| is fast even in huge files.

MAPPINGS AND COMMANDS                           *searchindex-mappings*

New mapping, *g/* is provided to display current search index on demand.
If cursor is not on the match, number of matches before it is shown.
*:SearchIndex* ex command and *<Plug>SearchIndex* (in normal mode) do the same.
|g/| is not mapped if you map another key combination to |<Plug>SearchIndex|.

Additionally, you can call *searchindex#MatchCounts()* to obtain number of
search matches (as a 2-element array: [current, total]) in a script.

STAR OVERRIDE                                   *searchindex-star*

Vim has a family of "star" commands that search for a word under cursor
(*, #, g* and g#). These commands are very useful, but they have a quirk -
they ignore 'smartcase' setting. This makes it impossible to reliably
calculate number of matches after "star" search.

To work around this problem, SearchIndex reimplements "star" commands.
As a bonus, it allows specifying case-sensitivity of "star" commands indepen-
dently from other search commands (which are controlled by 'ignorecase').
See |searchindex-options| for configuration options.

OPTIONS                                         *searchindex-options*

*g:searchindex_improved_star*     (default: 1)

  Whether to override "star" commands. Disabling this may cause occasional
  miscounting of search matches (especially with 'smartcase' enabled).

*g:searchindex_star_case*         (default: 1)

  Whether "star" search should be case-sensitive.

*g:searchindex_line_limit*        (default: 1 million)

  Maximum file size, in lines, on which SearchIndex will work. This can be
  used to prevent slowing down search in huge files (although note that after
  initial search is done, stepping with |n| / |N| is fast due to caching).

*g:searchindex_next_key*          (default: "n")

  SearchIndex will use this key to jump to the next match, and this key
  uppercase to jump to the previous. On some layouts it is convenient to remap
  several keys to make hjkl work, and you may want to remap |n| as well.

KNOWN ISSUES                                    *searchindex-issues*

Although I put a lot of effort into making SearchIndex robust, there are still
some cases where matches are miscounted. This happens especially with regex
searches (e.g. "a*" in line full of 'a's). It's mostly because Vim itself
cannot decide how to count matches (for example, |:s| and |search()| may give
inconsistent results). In any case, miscounting should be limited to the
current line.
